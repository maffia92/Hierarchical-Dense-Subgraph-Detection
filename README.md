# Hierarchical-Dense-Subgraph-Detection
## Overview
The package contains the following files:
- hidden.m: HiDDen algorithm to detect hierarchical dense subgraphs in a unipartite network
- hidden_bipartite.m: HiDDen algorithm to detect hierarchical dense subgraphs in a bipartite network
- hidden_query.m: HiDDen algorithm to query hierarchical dense subgraphs for a given set of seed nodes in a unipartite network
- demo.m: a demo code file 
- coauthor_net.mat: includes the adjacency matrix of the co-author network
- financial.mat: includes the adjacency matrix of the bipartite financial network

## Usage
Please refer to the demo code file demo.m and the descriptions in each file for the detailed information
